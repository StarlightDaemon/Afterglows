# Afterglows

An archive of web experiments, prototypes, and visual effects libraries. This repository acts as a long-term home for artifacts that have ongoing value.

## About

This repository serves as a permanent gallery for visual experiments that have graduated from active r&d but remain valuable references. These artifacts are maintained as static, standalone implementations using vanilla web technologies to ensure long-term preservation without dependency rot.

## Contents

- **Matrix Code**: A standalone CSS library for digital rain and cyberpunk text effects.
- **Retro**: A toolkit for CRT monitor effects, including scanlines and phosphor glow.
- **Concepts**: An archive of experimental header animations and UI concepts.

### Note on Stargate

The **Stargate** project has been promoted to its own dedicated workspace. It is no longer maintained in this repository.
