> **A living repository for web experiments, retro prototypes, and visual effects libraries.**

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project serves as an **experimental playground** and **archive**. **Afterglows** is an open-source collection of "scraped but cool" ideas, functional prototypes, and reusable CSS/JS libraries. It serves as a playground for retro-terminal aesthetics, sci-fi interfaces (Stargate, Matrix), and creative coding experiments.
- "Graveyard gold" - scrapped ideas worth preserving

**All code is open source and free to use.** Take what you need, learn from it, remix it, ship it.
