# Stargate Terminal Project Archive

This archive contains all research, prototypes, and code assets generated for the "Starlight Daemon" header terminal project.

## 📂 File Manifest

### 🌟 The "Best Of" (Functional Prototypes)
These are the most polished, functional versions ready for adaptation into a production site.

*   **`stargate_lcd_retro.html`** - **RECOMMENDED**. The definitive "Monitor/Terminal" version. Features a CSS-based 7-chevron dialing sequence, scanline flicker, chromatic aberration, and audio-visual cues (visual only currently).
*   **`stargate_canvas_retro.html`** - A 100% HTML5 Canvas implementation. Renders pixel-by-pixel for a true GameBoy/8-bit aesthetic. Use this if performance or strict retro visuals are the priority.
*   **`stargate_state_machine.html`** - A clean "State Machine" implementation separating Logic (JS) from View (CSS Grid). Good useful for integration into React/Vue apps.

### 🎨 Galleries & Variations
Collections of different visual styles to choose from.

*   **`all_stargate_variations.html`** - The massive "Multiverse" gallery containing **80 different styles** (Rust, Glass, Tron, ASCII, etc.).
*   **`stargate_dialing_earth_gallery.html`** - Comparisons of 6 different color schemes (Green, Amber, Red, Blue, etc.) animating simultaneously.
*   **`pixel_dialing_gallery.html`** - Specific focus on "Pixel Art" styles, comparing CSS `steps()` animation vs Canvas rendering.

### 📜 Historical / Legacy
*   **`stargate_mockup.html`** - The initial single static mockup.
*   **`stargate_variations_30.html`** - The first batch of 30 variations.
*   **`stargate_variations_50.html`** - The second batch of 50 variations.
*   **`legacy_header_mockups.html`** - The original project file containing non-Stargate concepts (Matrix rain, Hex grids, etc.).

### 📚 Documentation
*   **[TECHNICAL_RESEARCH.md](TECHNICAL_RESEARCH.md)** - Deep dive into the rendering approaches (Canvas vs DOM vs Steps).
*   **[ORIGINAL_README.md](ORIGINAL_README.md)** - Original project notes and decision log.

## 🛠 Integration Guide

### Option A: The "CSS Component" (Best for most sites)
Use the code from **`stargate_lcd_retro.html`**.
1. Copy the CSS inside `<style>` tags.
2. Copy the HTML structure (`<div class="terminal">...</div>`).
3. Copy the `<script>` block for the dialing logic.

### Option B: The "Game Object" (Best for retro consistency)
Use the code from **`stargate_canvas_retro.html`**.
1. Copy the `<canvas>` element.
2. The entire render loop is contained in the JS. This is self-contained and easy to drop in, but harder to style with CSS.

### Option C: The "Image" (Lightweight)
If you don't need animation logic, open `all_stargate_variations.html`, screenshot your favorite style, and use it as a static `.png`.

## 📝 Design Notes
*   **Scanlines**: We used a `repeating-linear-gradient` overlay with `pointer-events: none` to simulate CRT interlacing without blocking clicks.
*   **Phosphor Glow**: `text-shadow` and `box-shadow` are heavily used. For the "Retro" feel, we added specific Red/Blue offset shadows to simulate **Chromatic Aberration**.
*   **Animation**: For the pixel-art versions, we used `animation-timing-function: steps(N)` instead of `linear` to prevent the rotation from looking "too smooth" and modern.
